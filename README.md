# VRCHAT-Profile-Generator

This plug-in automatically sets up avatar profile tasks.

Insert the camera and the desired image and click on the "Generate Profile" button to generate the "Quad" and set the "Camera" to the VRCHAT thumbnail specification.

For a camera, the user must automatically select "VRCCam" from the upload screen status and specify the camera by themselves.
